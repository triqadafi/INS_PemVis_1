001: [Chorus: Elley Duhé]
002: You're a world away
003: Somewhere in the crowd
004: In a foreign place
005: Are you happy now?
006: There's nothing left to say
007: So I shut my mouth
008: So won't you tell me, babe
009: Are you happy now?
010: 
011: [Verse 1: Elley Duhé]
012: You're the only one who can up and run
013: Leave me just as empty as the day you came
014: And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
015: Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain
016: 
017: [Pre-Chorus: Elley Duhé]
018: And only you know the strength of your teeth
019: The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
020: And lonely
021: 
022: [Chorus: Elley Duhé]
023: You're a world away
024: Somewhere in the crowd
025: In a foreign place
026: Are you happy now?
027: There's nothing left to say
028: So I shut my mouth
029: So won't you tell me, babe
030: Are you happy now?
031: Are you happy now?
032: 
033: [Post-Chorus]
034: You're the only one who can
035: 
036: [Verse 2: Elley Duhé]
037: In the palm of your hands you can make me dance
038: Spin me around in circles till I'm wrapped in string
039: You keep on talking sweet till your fingers bleed
040: But don't you dare ask me how I've been
041: 
042: [Pre-Chorus: Elley Duhé]
043: Now only you know the strength of your teeth
044: The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
045: And lonely
046: 
047: [Chorus: Elley Duhé]
048: You're a world away
049: Somewhere in the crowd
050: In a foreign place
051: Are you happy now?
052: There's nothing left to say
053: So I shut my mouth
054: So won't you tell me, babe
055: Are you happy now?
056: Are you happy now?
057: 
058: [Post-Chorus]
059: You're the only one who can
060: You're the only, you're the only
061: You're the only one who can
062: You're the only, you're the only
063: 
064: [Outro]
065: World away
066: Somewhere in the crowd
067: In a foreign place
068: Are you happy now?
069: There's nothing left to say
070: So I shut my mouth
071: So won't you tell me, babe
072: Are you happy now?
